today we gonna talk about api
this gonna be one of the important topics 
that we have 


api=aplication programming interfaces
An API is a set of 
rules and protocols that allows
 one software application to 
 request and exchange data or
  services with another application,
   without knowing its internal
    implementation.

we need to learn about rest api
for connecting client and server we use rest api

1.http & https protocol would be used 
(this is rest frontend+backend)
2.Methods
Get->retrieve a resourse or a list of resourses.should not modify data on the server
post ->creates a new resource 
put->fpr updating the resource
patch->small part updation simmilar like put
delete->resource already exist on server used to delete its


post gives us lots of tools
by which we can create and develop api very easily


request goes onto request.body

req=all the data coming from the frontend
we can acess from req

res=used when we want to send response to the request from the data


user->request+some data(as a jason)->take it as json in server 

request.params=>indexing /notes/:index

when we need to transfer single value then 
using param is the best option

otherwise req.body is good option

which one to use
in terms of using updation Methods
->patch(only a single part)
