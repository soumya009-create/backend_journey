MongoDB Atlas is a cloud database service that acts as a database server, so we don’t need to install MongoDB locally.
We create clusters and databases on Atlas.
MongoDB Compass is a GUI tool used to view and perform CRUD operations on the database.
The MongoDB URI is the connection string used by clients like Compass and Mongoose to connect to the Atlas cluster.
Mongoose is used to connect the MongoDB database with the Express backend server.
